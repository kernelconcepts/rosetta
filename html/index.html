    <a name="description"><h2>Description</h2></a>
    <p>
      Rosetta is a new handwriting recognition engine for the X Window System. It supports multi stroke recognition and recognition for whole words / sentences. 
      It captures characters written in a small window with a pointing device (mouse, tablet or pen), recognizes them and passes the relating keypress events to 
      the actualy focused window.
     <br>
      You can write multi characters at once, but they may not be connected (like script). Single characters are recognized depending on the field you write in 
      (lowercase, uppercase or special characters), multiple characters are recognizes as lower case characters .
      </p><p>
      Rosetta has been developed on Linux systems, (i386 and StrongARM), but should be quite portable to any reasonable system with X.
    </p><p>
      Rosetta is <a href="#freesw">free software</a> distributed under
      the GNU General Public License, (<a href="#GPL">GPL</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the ideas that have gone into the development of Rosetta are derived from <a href="http://www.hellkvist.org/software/index.php3">xmerlin</a>, 
      written by Stefan Hellkvist. To His Ideas I added the multi stroke support and some more classification functions, resulting in Rosetta.

    <a name="download"><h2>Download</h2></a>
    <p>
      There still is no final release of Rosetta, so please download the source from handhelds cvs by now.
    </p>
    <p>
     In short, if you are not (yet?) a developer, you do the following to get an initial copy of the Rosetta sources:
     <pre>
        $ cd rosetta_cvs
        $ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.handhelds.org:/cvs
        $ cvs login
        Logging in to :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.handhelds.org:2401/cvs
        CVS Password: anoncvs
        $ cvs checkout rosetta
     </pre>

     You only have to do this once. The next time you want to update
     your copy of the sources, do:
     <pre>
        $ cd rosetta_cvs
        $ cvs update
     </pre>
     </p><p>
       For a more detailed description about how to use handhelds.org CVS, please see
       <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/handhelds-faq/development.html#USING-CVS">here</a>.
     </p><p>
       You can examine the CVS repository directly <a HREF="http://cvs.handhelds.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rosetta/">here</a>.

     <a name="compile"><h2>Compiling rosetta</h2></a>
	To compile rosetta you will need X11 and a C compiler. for the rosetta learning application you'll also need GTK 2.x and the
	GPE build framework (e.g. libgpewidget)
	<p>
	If you would like to compile rosetta, simply edit the Makefile to
	point to correct locations for X and GPE and the type "make". (Yes, this is
	a primitive build environment -- something fancy like autoconf perhaps will
	come in a future release).
	<p>
	To install, simply type	"make install"

    <a name="usage"><h2>Using rosetta</h2></a>
    </p><p>	
	The rosetta package consists of two applications. rosetta itself and the
	rosetta leaning application.
	<p>
	Running rosetta the first time will result in a long startup time. There
	will be done some precalculations which will be saved in
	<p>
	<pre>
	/usr/local/share/rosetta/rosetta.pc
	</pre>
	<p>
	Rosetta will be installed together with a standard config file for german
	and english characters. The config file is located in
	<p>
	<pre>
	/etc/rosetta.conf
	</pre>
	<p>
	Rosetta neets a database of known strokes. The one shipped with rosetta
	contains my handwriting. You could create your own by starting the learning
	application, klick on the "learn" button and then write character by
	character all characters shown in the "Name" field. Every character can
	contain of one or more strokes. After closing the
	learning application your own database is saved.
	<p>
	The global database is located at:
	<p><pre>
	/usr/local/share/rosetta/rosetta.db
	</pre><p>
	The user database is located at:
	<p><pre>
	~/.rosetta/rosetta.db
	</pre><p>
	After starting rosetta itself you'll get a small input window. With
	mbdesktop it will be integrated as new input method. The input window is
	seperated into three fields.
	<p>
	Field "abc" is dedicated to lower case characters / numbers and some
	interpunctation characters.
	<br>
	Field "ABC" is dedicated to upper case characters and also numbers and some
	interpunctation characters.
	<br>
	Field "Symbol" is dedicated to all other characters and special function
	keys (eg. cursor keys, function keys etc.)
	<p>
	If you write only one character the field you write in will be respected. If
	you write more than one character all characters will be assumed to be lower
	characters / numbers or some of the interpunctation characters (same as if
	you wrote in "abc" field). All characters have to be seperated from each
	other, so you may not write script but "printed characters".
	<p>
	If you write more than one word rosetta will try to find out the word
	seperation.
	<p>
	The german "umlaute" (e.g. הצ) wont have their own representation in the
	database. They will be matched by the number of "dots" you wrote on top of
	the character. This is configurable in the config file.
	<p>
	In the learning application you can overwrite each character by hand or
	learn the whole configured alphabet. To overwrite a single character simply
	navigate to the character and then write the new one. To train the whole
	alphabet navigate to the first alphabet and press the learn button. Now
	write every character as shown in the "name" label. As configured in the
	config file every character is repeatet several times in the database to get
	better results in the recognition.
	<p>
	Automatic learning is stopped by navigation in the database or by changing
	to the testmode.
	<p>
	In testmode (Test tab) you can write characters and words an will see the
	result in the input box.
