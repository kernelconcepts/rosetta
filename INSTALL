Howto install Rosetta
---------------------

After unpacking the file type:
make
make install


Hopefully this will install Rosetta in /usr/local/bin and the
configuration files (config, database and precalculations) in
characters in /usr/local/share/rosetta. If this does not suite you you
need to edit the Makefile to fit your needs. 

Cross compiling
---------------

Cross compilation is no problem. You need to edit the
Makefile. Edit CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, CC and STRIP to fit your
system. Rosetta has succesfully been built this way on an i386 using
arm-linux-gcc.
